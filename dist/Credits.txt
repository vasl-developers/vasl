VASL and the VASSAL engine were written by Rodney Kinney (vasl@vasl.org), but
they are far from the work of one man. New counter artwork in version 5 was
contributed by Kenn Monte, Ken Knudsen, Jeff Leslie, Eric Givler, and Zoltan
Grose. Counter redesign was done by Jeffrey Malter. Tom Repetti contributed
map work, terrain design, and overall moral support. David Sullivan has allowed
use of his Java libraries for computing LOS. David Lake (www.lakewebworks.com)
designed the VASL web site. Thanks to counter trolls Klaus Fischer, Scott Brady,
Sam Tyson, Brad Hampson, and Carl Fung. Thanks to map gnomes Tim Fachko, Gordon
Molek, Carl Pfeiffer, and Bruce Mansfield. Thanks to Gary Krockover for the
TurnPhase indicator, and to Ole Bøe for permission to use his IIFT(M)QRDC.
GameSquad users 'General Mayhem' and 'wlk' contributed code for VASL 5.9.

Finally, thanks to Multi-Man Publishing for their selfless support
of the ASL hobby, and their continued indulgence of VASL.
