--Checking LOS

    VASL 5.0 features automatic LOS checking, courtesy of David Sullivan. LOS
checking works on single boards, cropped boards, or across multiple boards. LOS
does account for terrain transformations (e.g. Grain out of season), but doesn't
know about overlays. You may enable or disable LOS checking in the "LOS" tab of
the preferences.

   After pressing the LOS button, left click the mouse in any hex (the "source"
hex) and drag the mouse to any other hex (the "target" hex) to check the LOS.
You may select the highest location in a hex by holding the control key (Ctrl)
down when clicking or dragging the mouse. If the mouse pointer is not in the
center of a hex, the LOS will be checked to/from the nearest hex spine (The
'Snap thread to grid' preference is ignored when LOS checking is enabled). The
last LOS checked remains displayed on the screen as long as VASL is in LOS mode.
Note that if the 'Retain LOS-hindrance counters' preference is yes (checked),
the hindrance counters that remain on the screen during the LOS check WILL
affect the results.

   The LOS thread uses three different colors: a basic thread color, a hindrance
color, and a blocked color, all of which are customizable in the Edit Properties
dialog. The LOS thread starts with the basic color, indicating a clear LOS,
changes to the hindrance color at the point of the first hindrance, and then
changes to the blocked color at the point where the LOS is blocked.

   If the "Verbose LOS Mode" preference box is checked, text messages closest to
the source and target locations will display the name and elevation of the
locations. A second text message, near the target location, will display the
range and the result of the LOS check. If the LOS is clear, but hindrances where
detected, the number of hindrances will be given. If the LOS is blocked, the hex
where it is blocked and the reason will be shown.

While the LOS is visible, you may move the source and target
locations up and down within the hex using these keystrokes:

Keystroke		Moves
---------		-----
Up arrow		Move the target location up
Down arrow		Move the target location down
Ctrl+Up arrow		Move the source location up
Ctrl+Down arrow	Move the source location down

If no locations exist above or below the current one,
the keystroke is ignored.
