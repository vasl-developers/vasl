Three buttons (& fkeys) control shading of the map:
	Night (F9)
	LV Hindrance (F11)
	Dust

Their effects are partly visual, and don't alter the operation of the existing
LOS mechanism. Night effects can obscure the images of the LOS-string & its msg-
flags, but it doesn't change or alter the content of the LOS-string/msgs. One
can toggle Night off while checking LOS, then turn it back on.

Night causes a grey-screen to be drawn over the entire map, including any ctrs.
Certain ctrs/overlays (as defined in Ch. E) will automatically 'erase' the Night
effects from areas of the map, but won't affect the LV Hindrance shading. For
example, a Prep/Def/Gunflash/Flame marker will 'unshade' its hex. An FFE overlay
will 'unshade' all 7 hexes of its blast area. A Blaze ctr will unshade all 19
hexes (2-hex radius) of its 'illumination area'. Starshell and IR ctrs/overlays
behave in a similar fashion.

The Flame ctr will automatically increase the size of its illumination
when it is ctrl-F Flipped to a Blaze. The Trip Flare ctr will activate its
illumination when it is unHIPped, but won't illuminate while HIP.

The shaded map, LOS engine, and any applied 'unshade' ctrs/overlays, are 'dumb'
to the existing map-terrain. So, an applied illumination-area ctr/overlay will
unshade areas that, by rule, should still be shaded. In this case, players must
manually apply 'shade' overlays to the obscured areas. These overlays will not
respond to the 'unshade' effects of the ctrs, and must be manually replaced
as needed.

A text reminder will be displayed for IFT and TH rolls in the chatter window to remind the player
that a +1 LV hindrance applies at night, with an adjusted total for the roll.

LV Hindrances

Each press of the LV Hindrance button cycles through a series of LV states:

1. LV Shading Only is in effect.
The map is shaded as a reminder that an LV hindrance is in effect.
2. +1 LV (E3.1) is in effect.
Shading is applied, and a text reminder will be displayed for IFT and TH rolls in the chatter window to remind the player
that a +1 LV hindrance is in effect, with an adjusted total for the roll.
3. Mist (E3.32) +0/+1/... is in effect.
4. Rain (E3.51) +0/+1/... is in effect.
5. Heavy Rain (E3.51) +1/+2/... is in effect.
6. Falling Snow (3.71) +0/+1/... is in effect.
7. Heavy Falling Snow(3.71) +1/+2/... is in effect.
For 3-7, shading is applied, and an LV reminder will be displayed for IFT and TH rolls in the chatter window.

8. No LV is in effect.
Shading is removed.

Dust

Each press of the Dust button cycles through the dust levels as described in Chapter F.11 of the rulebook
and changes VASL behaviour as follows:

1. Light Dust (F11.71) is in effect.
2. Moderate Dust (F11.72) is in effect.
3. Heavy Dust (F11.73) is in effect.
4. Very Heavy Dust (F11.731) is in effect.
5. Extremely Heavy Dust (F11.732) is in effect.
For 1-5, progressive dust shading is applied, and a third dust die is rolled for you for IFT, TH and
MC (for interdiction) rolls, with the dust die roll added to a total (FRD or FRD as required) and displayed in the
chatter window.

6. No Dust is in effect.
Shading is removed.

The color of the dust die can be changed using the color picker in Preferences -> 'Chat Window' tab -> Third die color.
